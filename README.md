In this app I created a replica of Tinder using React, Express, MongoDB, and Node.js (MERN). Icons were imported from Material-UI react components, and MongoDB was used to store the project's data (in this case the tinder cards). The backend was deployed using heroku, and the frontend was deployed using Firebase.
